MITRE ATT&CK:
  Reconnaissance: N/A.
  Resource Development: N/A.
  Initial Access: N/A.
  Execution: N/A.
  Persistence: N/A.
  Privilege Escalation: N/A.
  Defense Evasion: VM/Sandbox evasion.
  Credential Access: N/A.
  Discovery: N/A.
  Lateral Movement: N/A.
  Collection: N/A.
  Command and Control: N/A.
  Exfiltration: N/A.
  Impact: N/A.

Summary: 
    Analysis failed, due to improper sandboxing conditions on the behalf of 
  intezer's enviroment. Since, it lead to the likely false flagging of a positive
  and various false negatives.

Conclusion:
    As a result of the virus being a worm and intezer only managing 
  to detect defense evasion. It is clear that the malware will require 
  manual analysis of its Att&ck capabilities in order to replicate the 
  instances in which the virus originally spread. 

Current hypothesis:
    The automated MITRE analysis failed, due to miss configuration
  on the part of intezer's analysis system. In the analysis several obvious positives,
  went unmarked and an unlikely trait was marked positive. As defense evasion was put 
  down as VM/Sandbox evasion leading me to believe this to be the result of a false 
  flag. Since this is a highly unlikely trait for a piece of malware from 2004.
