Summary: False negatives & presumably false positives.

Conclusion: As a result of the virus being a worm and intezer only managing 
to detect defense evasion. It is clear that the malware will require 
manual analysis of its Att&ck capabilities in order to replicate the 
instances in which the virus originally spread. 

Current hypothesis: The automated MITRE analysis failed, due to miss configuration
on the part of intezer's analysis system. In the analysis several obvious positives,
went unmarked and an unlikely trait was marked positive. As defense evasion was put 
down as VM/Sandbox evasion leading me to believe this to be the result of a false 
flag. Since this is a highly unlikely trait for a piece of malware in 2004.
