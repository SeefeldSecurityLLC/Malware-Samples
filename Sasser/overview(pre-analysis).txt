Incident description: 
    On May 7th, 2004, Sven Jaschan released a computer virus named Sasser out of Germany. 
  The virus itself affected all current operating versions of Windows XP and Windows 2000 running at the 
  time. Since it targeted vulerable ports the virus was able to spread free of user interaction, yet was
  easily stopped by proper configuration of ones firewall before being patched. In subsequent Windows 
  releases two weeks later, the virus was crippled containg the spread to only hugely misconfigured and 
  outdated systems.

Symptoms of infected hosts:
      On the systems infected by the virus users would notice the presence 
  of mysterious c files. Which inlcude entries such as C:\win.log, C:\win2.log, and 
  C:\WINDOWS\avserve2.exe on the local disk. FTP.exe would also run at 100% cpu utilization causing the 
  system to crash randomly along with an LSA shell in someinstances. Which would frequently cause a 
  shutdown timer to appear appearing because of LSASS.exe overconsumption of resources.

Prevention:
    Updating Windows to the latest version possible & firewall/acl configuration blocking FTP(ports 20  & 21).
      
Remediation:
    Windows update, manual killing of proccesses accross the network, or complete network restore from back ups.
