//Description: On May 7th, 2004, Sven Jaschan released a computer virus named Sasser out of Germany. 
The virus itself affected all current operating versions of Windows XP and Windows 2000 running at the 
time. Since it targeted vulerable ports the virus was able to spread free of user interaction, yet was
easily stopped by proper configuration of ones firewall before being patched. In subsequent Windows 
releases two weeks later, the virus was crippled containg the spread to only hugely misconfigured and 
outdated systems.

//Symptoms of an infected hosts: On the systems infected by the virus users would notice the presence 
of mysterious c files. Which inlcude entries such as C:\win.log, C:\win2.log, and 
C:\WINDOWS\avserve2.exe on the local disk. FTP.exe would also run at 100% cpu utilization causing the 
system to crash randomly along with an LSA shell in someinstances. Which would frequently cause a 
shutdown timer to appear appearing because of LSASS.exe overconsumption of resources.
