#Prewritten (Not my own) Malware-Samples (Windows & Mac OS)
This repository is a collection of some of the most dangerous pieces of malware to be released into the public domain in recent years. It is not intended for users to use maliciously, but for people to better educate themselves on the threats they face. When they go online and use primarily windows or Mac OS based systems both unprotected and uninformed. The intended purpose of this reposting is to be used in conjunction with a upcoming series of analysis reports on the subject matter. Followed by a potential subsequent series of notes on preventions and response.
